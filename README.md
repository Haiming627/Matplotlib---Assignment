Three Observations:

1: There is a relatively strong correlation between the weight of the mouse and the average tumor volume of the mouse based on the data we have for Capomulin, however, this does not suggest a causation between the two factors as there are multiple other factors involved.

2: Based on the data we gathered from this sample, Ramicane shows the most prominent treatment result as among the mice tested under the use of Ramicane, showed that these mice have the lowest average tumor volume and the median tumor volume.

3. Between the four treatments Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin, Capomulin and Ramicane showed a more lasting effect as the final tumor volume of the mice tested under these two drugs are significantly small than the other two.
